# 2D Truss Analysis, COE321K Spring 2024

Write a 2D truss MATLAB code to analyze the deformation and stresses in the structure due to the applied loads  where 𝑄 = 1000 lbs, 𝐿 = 1 ft., and the outer members a cross sectional area 16 in^2 whereas the inner members indicated by thin lines have a cross sectional area of 4 in^2 with a modulus of elasticity E = 30 x 10^6 psi.
